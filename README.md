## 🔍 What is Kubernetes?

Kubernetes (also known as **K8s**) is an open-source platform that automates:

- 🔄 Deployment  
- ⚙️ Scaling  
- 🔁 Load balancing  
- 💥 Self-healing of containerized applications  

It was originally designed by **Google**, and now it's maintained by the **Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF)**.

## ❓ Why Kubernetes?

Imagine running hundreds of containers... manually! 🥲  
Kubernetes helps simplify and automate complex container operations in **DevOps and cloud-native environments**.
