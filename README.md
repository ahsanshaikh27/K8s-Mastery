## 📌 What is Kubernetes?

**Kubernetes** (also called **K8s**) is an open-source container orchestration platform that automates the deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications.

It was originally developed by Google and is now maintained by the **Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF)**.

## 🤔 Why Kubernetes?

Before Kubernetes, managing containers (like Docker) across multiple servers was manual and error-prone. Kubernetes solves this by:

* 🧠 **Automating deployment** of containers
* 📈 **Scaling up/down** applications automatically
* 🧪 **Self-healing** (restarting failed containers)
* 🌐 **Service discovery** and **load balancing**
* 🛡️ **Secure and declarative configuration management**

## ✅ Benefits of Kubernetes

| Benefit                | Description                                                      |
| ---------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 🚀 Scalability         | Automatically scale your application up or down                  |
| 🛠️ Automation         | Handles rollouts, rollbacks, and container restarts              |
| 📦 Resource Efficiency | Better hardware utilization using container scheduling           |
| 🔁 High Availability   | Keeps apps running by auto-restarting and load balancing         |
| 🔐 Security            | Built-in secrets management and role-based access control (RBAC) |
| 🔍 Observability       | Logs, metrics, and monitoring tools integration                  |
