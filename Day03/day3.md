# Kubernetes Production Pods Setup

This repository demonstrates best practices for running Kubernetes Pods in production environments with a focus on:

* Pod Lifecycle & Health
* Sidecar vs Init Containers
* Security using Trivy and Kyverno
* Pod Restart Policies & Termination
* Production-grade YAML examples

---

## üì¶ 1. Pods in Production

### Key Considerations:

* Always deploy Pods using higher-level controllers like **Deployment** (for stateless apps) or **StatefulSet** (for stateful apps).
* Define **liveness** and **readiness probes** to monitor pod health and ensure traffic is only routed to healthy containers.
* Configure **resource requests and limits** to enable efficient resource scheduling and prevent pod eviction due to resource overuse.
* Set the appropriate `imagePullPolicy`:

  * `Always`: Ensures the latest image is pulled.
  * `IfNotPresent`: Uses the locally cached image if available.

### Pod Lifecycle Phases:

1. **Pending**: The Pod has been accepted but one or more containers are not yet created.
2. **Running**: The Pod has been scheduled and all containers are running.
3. **Succeeded**: All containers have terminated successfully.
4. **Failed**: At least one container terminated with an error.
5. **Unknown**: The state of the Pod could not be determined.

## üß© 2. Sidecar vs Init Containers

Both Init and Sidecar containers are auxiliary containers used alongside the main application container, but they serve different purposes:

| Feature              | Init Container                         | Sidecar Container                         |
| -------------------- | -------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| **Purpose**          | Prepares environment before app starts | Enhances functionality alongside main app |
| **Lifecycle**        | Runs sequentially before app container | Runs in parallel with app container       |
| **Common Use Cases** | Database migrations, config downloads  | Logging, monitoring, reverse proxies      |
| **Restart Behavior** | Restarts until successful              | Follows Pod restart policy                |

### Example Use Cases:

* **Init Container**: Download required configuration files, run database migrations, wait for a dependent service to be available.
* **Sidecar Container**: Stream logs to external service, collect metrics, or provide a proxy like Envoy.

## üõ°Ô∏è 3. Security Tools

### ‚úÖ Trivy - Vulnerability Scanner

Trivy is a simple and comprehensive tool to scan container images for vulnerabilities.

```bash
trivy image nginx:latest
```

* Scans OS-level packages and app dependencies.
* Identifies known CVEs.
* Can be automated within CI/CD pipelines.

### ‚úÖ Kyverno - Kubernetes Policy Engine

Kyverno helps enforce security and best practices at the cluster level.

#### Use Kyverno for:

* **Validation**: Prevent usage of `latest` tag or privileged containers.
* **Mutation**: Automatically label pods or inject configurations.
* **Enforcement**: Ensure containers follow policy guidelines.

#### Example: Block Pods using `latest` tag

```yaml
apiVersion: kyverno.io/v1
kind: ClusterPolicy
metadata:
  name: disallow-latest-tag
spec:
  validationFailureAction: enforce
  rules:
    - name: validate-image-tag
      match:
        resources:
          kinds:
            - Pod
      validate:
        message: "Using 'latest' tag is not allowed"
        pattern:
          spec:
            containers:
              - image: "!*:latest"
```

---

## üîÅ 4. Restart Policies

Pod restart behavior is controlled by the `restartPolicy` field:

| Policy      | Description                                         |
| ----------- | --------------------------------------------------- |
| `Always`    | Always restarts the container if it exits (default) |
| `OnFailure` | Restarts container only on non-zero exit codes      |
| `Never`     | Container is not restarted after it exits           |

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Backoff Strategy:

* Kubernetes uses an **exponential backoff** strategy:

  * 10s ‚Üí 20s ‚Üí 40s ... up to 5 minutes.
* Useful in preventing constant retries that consume resources.

---

## ‚õîÔ∏è 5. Pod Termination

When deleting a Pod, Kubernetes follows this termination sequence:

### Termination Flow:

1. `kubectl delete pod` is issued.
2. Pod enters **Terminating** state.
3. A **grace period** (default: 30 seconds) begins.
4. Kubernetes sends a **SIGTERM** signal to containers.
5. After grace period, **SIGKILL** is sent to forcibly terminate the container.

### Force Delete:

To skip the grace period:

```bash
kubectl delete pod <pod-name> --grace-period=0 --force
```

---

## üîê 6. Security Context

Security contexts define privilege and access controls for pods or containers.

### Best Practices:

* Run as a non-root user.
* Disable privilege escalation.
* Avoid running privileged containers.

```yaml
securityContext:
  runAsNonRoot: true
  runAsUser: 1000
  allowPrivilegeEscalation: false
```

| Tool        | Purpose                              |
| ----------- | ------------------------------------ |
| Trivy       | Image vulnerability scanning         |
| Kyverno     | Kubernetes policy enforcement        |
| K9s         | TUI for managing Kubernetes clusters |
